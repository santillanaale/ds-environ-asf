The following section should be completed after the BARC has been field validated by the BAER team and this entire metadata file should be returned to GTAC with the Soil Burn Severity data.

Fire name: Terwilliger

 
    BAER Assessment Completion Date: 10/12/2018
    BAER Team GIS Analyst: David Keenum
    BAER Team Leader: Fred Levitan
    Soil Burn Severity Analyst(s): Sarah Brame
    
    Original BARC256 thresholds:
        Unburned / Undetectable: <=72
        Low: >73 and <=113
        Moderate: >114 and <=205
        High: >206
        
    Soil Burn Severity thresholds:
        Unburned / Undetectable: <=60
        Low:>61 and <=127
        Moderate: >128 and <= 225
        High: >226 
        
    Sequence of steps used to create Soil Burn Severity data: 
	1) adjusted BARC Threasholds
	2) Reprojected to R6 Albers coordinate system

    
    Additional Comments:

Generally, decreased High, Moderate Severity slightly, increased Low Severity significantly, and decreased Unburned Severity significantly.  
Heavy live canopy may have obstructed low severity burn area.
