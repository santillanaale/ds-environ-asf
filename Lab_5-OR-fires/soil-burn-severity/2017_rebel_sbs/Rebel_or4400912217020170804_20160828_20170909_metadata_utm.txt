    Description
        Abstract: These data products are preliminary burn severity assessments derived from Landsat 8 OLI data. The pre-fire and post-fire subsets included were used to create a differenced Normalized Burn Ratio (dNBR) image. The dNBR image attempts to portray the variation of burn severity within a fire. The severity ratings are influenced by the effects to the canopy.  The severity rating is based upon a composite of the severity to the understory (grass, shrub layers), midstory trees and overstory trees. Because there is often a strong correlation between canopy consumption and soil effects, this algorithm works in many cases for BAER teams whose objective is a soil burn severity assessment.  It is not, however, appropriate in all ecosystems or fires. It is expected that BAER teams will adjust the thresholds to match field observations to produce a soil burn severity.
        Purpose: These data were created by the USDA Forest Service Geospatial Technology and Applications Center (GTAC) to support Burned Area Emergency Response (BAER) teams.

    Access Constraints: Thresholded, preliminary severity estimates (BARC4 and BARC256) are only delivered to BAER teams. Further distribution is at the discretion of the BAER team leader. Pre-imagery, post-imagery, and unthresholded data are publicly available on http://activefiremaps.fs.fed.us/baer/download.php. Access to pre-imagery and post-imagery may be limited when sensors other than Landsat or other government remote sensing assets are used due to product licensing restrictions.
    Use Constraints:  There are no restrictions on use, except for reasonable and proper acknowledgement of information sources and limitations as preliminary/draft data.

    Lineage
        Process Step
            Process Description: These data products are derived from Landsat 8 OLI data. Pre-fire and post-fire scenes are analyzed to create a differenced Normalized Burn Ratio (dNBR) image. The dNBR image portrays the variation of burn severity within the fire. The pre- and post-fire images are terrain corrected and further processed to convert top of atmosphere reflectance. 
                The Normalized Burn Ratio (NBR) is computed for the pre- and post-fire images using the following formula:
                (NIR Band - SWIR Band) / (NIR Band + SWIR Band) = NBR

                The Differenced NBR is computed to determine severity by subtracting the post-fire NBR from the pre-fire NBR:
                (PreNBR - PostNBR) = dNBR

                The BARC products are a generalization of the raw, continuous dNBR dataset. Both BARC products have been resampled to unsigned 8-bit GeoTIFF and are easily viewed and edited within ArcGIS.

                The classes represented on the BARC products are created with thresholds chosen by an analyst at GTAC.  These thresholds can be roughly related back to original dNBR values by multiplying by 5 and then subtracting 275 (for example, a BARC256 value of 100 would relate to a dNBR value of 225).  The BARC thresholds used on this particular fire are:
                Unburned / Undetectable: All values less than or equal to 65.
                Low: All values greater than 65 and less than or equal to 100.
                Moderate: All values greater than 100 and less than or equal to 196.
                High: All values greater than 196.

                General descriptions of the severity classes are below:
                Unburned / Undetectable: This means the area after the fire was indistinguishable from pre-fire conditions. This does not always indicate the area did not burn (i.e. canopy may be occluding the burn signal).
                Low: This severity class represents areas of surface fire with little detected change in cover and little detected mortality of the dominant vegetation.
                Moderate: This severity class is between low and high and means there is a mixture of detected effects on the dominant vegetation.
                High: This severity class represents areas where the canopy has high to complete consumption.

The following section should be completed after the BARC has been field validated by the BAER team and this entire metadata file should be returned to GTAC with the Soil Burn Severity data.

    Original BARC256 thresholds:
        Unburned / Undetectable: <=76
        Low: >76 and <=110
        Moderate: >110 and <=198
        High: >198
        
    Soil Burn Severity thresholds:
        Unburned / Undetectable: <= 50
        Low: > 50 and < = 98
        Moderate: >98 and < = 180
        High: > 180
        
    Sequence of steps used to create Soil Burn Severity data:

	1. Some areas within the Rebel fire were masked due to cloud cover, etc or were missing soil burn severity calculations.  In order to fill in these no data gaps, the initial BARC map was 
	converted to a polygon feature class.  Polygons were built for the voids and assigned to the designated soil burn severity class. 
	2.  Vector data containing data updates was converted back to a raster dataset, classified within the four soil burn severity classes. 
	3.  The existing BARC data was reclassified using soil burn severity thresholds noted above. 
	4.  The converted raster dataset representing edited voids was mosaicked with the reclassified BARC data to produce the final SBS dataset for the entire fire area.
